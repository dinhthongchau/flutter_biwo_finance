# Finance Management App

Finance Management is a modern mobile application built with Flutter, designed to help you manage your personal finances smartly and securely. The app supports authentication, transaction management, analytics, notifications, category management, and more. Data is synchronized via Firebase, with push notifications and a beautiful, responsive UI. State management is handled with Bloc, and navigation uses GoRouter for smooth transitions.
